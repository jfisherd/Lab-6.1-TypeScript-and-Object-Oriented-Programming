# Lab 6.1, Advanced DOM Manipulation

## Description
In this lab, an inventory tracker capable of managing both physical and digital products is built to reinforce understanding of OOP. Inheritance is explored by creating a class called Product, then extended to either a PhysicalProduct or DigitalProduct



## Running the program

## Reflection Questions
> How does TypeScript enforce type safety in this object-oriented program?
TypeScript enforces type safety by allowing the user to specify the datatype of values, parameters, or outputs when a variable or function is declared.
<br>

> How did inheritance reduce code duplication for PhysicalProduct and DigitalProduct?
Inherited properties such as sku,. name, and price do not need to be redefined in PhysicalProducts.ts and DigitalProducts.ts
<br>

> What are the benefits of using encapsulation and access modifiers (public, private, protected) in this context?

<br>

> If you had to add a new type of product (e.g., a SubscriptionProduct), how would polymorphism make this extension straightforward?
